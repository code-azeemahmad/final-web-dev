why to learn React?
--> hype, job, trend, build UI
--> makes easy to manage and build complex frontend

why should I learn React?
--> after mastering JS
--> most project don't need react in initial phase

why was React created?
Phantom message problem
no sync between state --> JS and UI --> DOM

Don't learn React if:
you don't know how JS works or DOM works

React learning process:
--> go in depth
--> by making project

React is a framework
framework vs library

Topics to learn:
--> core of React(state or UI manipulation, JSX)
--> component Reuseability
--> Reusing of component(Props)
--> How to propagate change(Hooks)

Additional Add on to React:
--> Router(React does not have router)
--> State Management(React doesn't have state Management)
--> Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, context API
--> class based component
--> Legacy code
--> BAAS Apps(social media clone, e-commerce App)

After React:
--> React is not a complete solution in most case (no SEO, browser render of JS, no Routing)
--> Framework (Next JS, Gatsby, Remix)
